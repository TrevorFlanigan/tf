        Hi ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m Trevor - a curiosity-driven computer engineer with
        professional experience in React, Golang, Node, AWS, and more. I like to
        make stuff that is impactful, on projects where I can have a ton of
        ownership from end to end. I&apos;m a life-long learner, and I'm always
        looking for ways to apply and build upon my experience.
      </p>
